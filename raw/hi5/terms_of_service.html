Please also include your name and the email address, phone number, or other unique identifier you used to sign up for your account. This notice shall be sent to: The Meet Group, Attn: Cancellations, 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA. The Company's business is conducted, in part, at 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA. You may have these terms of use e-mailed to you by sending a letter to Tagged Terms Inquiries, 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938, USA. In accordance with Cal. Civ. Code §1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at Consumer Information Division, 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>

<p>This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") controls your access and use of Tagged and hi5 (collectively, the "Services") made available to you (the "Member") by The Meet Group, Inc. (“Company”). By downloading or using Tagged or hi5 you agree to this Agreement, our <a href="#privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</a>, and our <a href="https://terms.hi5.com/content-and-conduct">Content and Conduct Policy</a>. The Privacy Policy and the Content and Conduct Policy are each part of this Agreement. ONLY USERS WHO ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER MAY REGISTER FOR THE SERVICES. By accessing the services and/or completing the registration process for one of our Services, you represent that you are 18 years of age or older, and can and will be legally bound by this Agreement. By registering for one of our Services, you represent and warrant that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any government entity. No Member may participate where doing so would be prohibited by any applicable law or regulation. We have created side summaries to help you easily locate specific terms within this Agreement.  These summaries are for reference only and in the event that there is a discrepancy between this Agreement and the language of the side summaries, the Agreement will prevail.</p>

<h3 id="A">A) Changes to the Terms</h3>

<p>The Company reserves the right to change or amend this Agreement at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all, at the Company’s sole discretion. The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Services. Although the Company will provide notice of material changes to this Agreement on the Services, as a Member it is your sole responsibility to keep yourself informed of any such changes or amendments. Should a Member object to any terms and conditions of the Agreement or any subsequent changes to the Agreement or become dissatisfied with the Company in any way, Member's only solution is to immediately: (1) discontinue use of the Services; (2) terminate their Services registration; and (3) notify the Company of termination.</p>

<h3 id="B">B) Description of Services</h3>

<p>As a Member, you will be provided with a variety of Services, as described on the Services. Members may also use certain additional services offered from time to time such as shopping and e-commerce offerings and various informational services. The Company reserves the right to enhance, change, or discontinue the Services, in whole or in part, at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all, at the Company’s sole discretion, with or without notice to Members, and with no obligation to Members.</p>

The Company reserves the right, but does not assume any obligation, to monitor the Services to enforce this Agreement. Nor does the Company guarantee that any monitoring it does perform will be to the Member's satisfaction. Upon learning of any violation of this Agreement, the Company, at its sole discretion, may terminate your access to and use of the Services, require you to correct such violation, and/or take any other actions that the Company deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue all available remedies. Without limitation, the Company reserves the right to terminate your access to and use of the Services if, in our view, your conduct fails to meet any of the following guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>Members shall not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Company’s database or other computer systems.</li>
<li>Members shall not attempt to change, translate, adapt, edit, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any software programs used by Company in connection with the Services.</li>

</ol>

<p><a id="CS"></a></p>

<p>All decisions concerning the applicability of these guidelines shall be at the sole and exclusive discretion of the Company and its designees. The Company has the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or remove any content that is available via the Services. The Company and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates this Agreement or is otherwise objectionable. An account may be terminated at any time, without notice, depending on the severity of the offense, which is determined exclusively at the discretion of the Company.

Purchases or other acquisitions of Gold provide only a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, fully-revocable license to use such Gold to access Services that we expressly make available for use with such Gold for your personal non-commercial use. Gold is redeemable only on the Tagged site for Tagged digital merchandise and content. Gold does not expire. Gold is non-refundable. Gold has no monetary value and does not constitute currency or property of any type. Gold is not transferable or assignable. You will not be entitled to a refund, money or any other compensation for unused Gold and virtual items when an account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary.</p>

<p>You may use Gold to purchase Gifts for other users. The price for each Gift will be displayed at the point of purchase. Gifts constitute a limited license to access a certain feature on the Tagged platform when, as, and if allowed by Tagged. All sales of Gifts are final and Tagged does not offer refunds for any purchased Gifts. Tagged is not responsible for repairing or replacing Gifts, or providing you with any credit or refund in the event that Tagged modifies, suspends, or terminates the Gift program, or for loss or damage due to any service error, or any other reason.</p>

<p>Gifts purchased or received by any user do not constitute property and are not transferable.</p>

<h3 id="K">K) Copyrights, Trademarks, Patents and Intellectual Property Rights</h3>

<p>“Content” means all data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, artwork, video, pictures, images, posts, broadcasts, messages or other materials of any kind, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted. Your Content is your sole responsibility. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents and permissions to publish all of your Content. Except as set forth in our Privacy Policy, we are not responsible for any Content that you upload or transmit on the Services. We do not control the posted Content and, as such, we do not control its accuracy, integrity, quality or any other aspect. Under no circumstances are we liable in any way for any Content, including but not limited to any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content.</p>

<p>You hereby grant the Company a perpetual, assignable, world-wide, royalty free, sub-licensable and non-exclusive license to use, distribute, reproduce, record, modify, adapt, process, combine, synchronize, create derivative works from, publish, publicly perform and publicly display such Content (including your user name and likeness) on the Services and elsewhere in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed) for any promotional and other commercial purpose, whether by us, our partners or other third parties, in our sole discretion.</p>

<p>This license authorizes the Company to make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. You agree that this license includes the right for the Company to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to the Company’s terms and conditions for such Content use.  Such additional uses by the Company, or other companies, organizations or individuals, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services.</p>

<p>The Company may use your feedback, comments and suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them. The Company may continue to use and make available any and all Content and the Company will continue to have all of these rights even if your account is terminated.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that the Company does not promise to screen Content, but that it has the right to do so. The Company has the right to remove any Content that violates this Agreement or that it finds objectionable. You accept liability associated with the use of any Content, including but not limited to your reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
You may not reproduce, republish, further distribute or publicly exhibit any Content on the Services that is not yours.</p>

<p>The Company respects copyright law and expects Members to do the same. Illegal or unauthorized copying, distribution, modification, public display, or public performance of copyrighted works is an infringement of the copyright holders' rights. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please notify the Company’s Agent for Notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement ("Agent"), at:</p>

<p>The Meet Group
Copyright Agent
100 Union Square Drive,
New Hope, PA 18938
(215) 862-1162
<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x63;&#111;&#112;&#x79;&#114;&#105;&#x67;&#x68;&#116;&#64;&#x74;&#104;&#101;&#x6d;&#x65;&#101;t&#x67;&#114;&#111;&#x75;&#x70;&#46;c&#x6f;&#109;">copyright@themeetgroup.com</a></p>

<p>Please provide our Agent with the following Notice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identify the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;</li>
<li>Identify the material on the Services that you claim is infringing, with enough detail so that we may locate it on the website;</li>
<li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
<li>A statement by you declaring under penalty of perjury that (a) the above information in your Notice is accurate, and (b) that you are the owner of the copyright interest involved or that you are authorized to act on behalf of that owner;</li>
<li>Your address, telephone number, and email address; and</li>
<li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Company’s Agent will forward this information to the alleged infringer. It is Company’s policy to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.</p>

<h3 id="L">L) Disputes</h3>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. You and the Company agree that, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, you and the Company shall seek to resolve any and all disputes between the Company and you, respectively, including, without limitation, all claims, counter-claims and cross-claims (collectively, "Claims"), whether in law, equity or otherwise, solely through individual arbitration in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in this Agreement. Such disputes shall include without limitation:</p>

<ul>
<li>disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to Company’s Terms of Service, Content and Conduct Policy, and/or Privacy Policy;</li>
<li>disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any Services and/or any content on our Services;</li>
<li>disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any information, communications and/or other material that you and/or any other person and/or entity provide to and/or through the Services;</li>
<li>disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any information and/or other material that is collected, stored and/or disseminated by, on behalf of and/or with the approval of the Company;</li>
<li>disputes arising out of and/or otherwise relating to any advertising and/or other communications by the Company in connection with the Services;</li>
<li>disputes that are the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class;</li>
<li>disputes that arose before you entered into this Agreement and/or any prior version of this Agreement;</li>
<li>disputes that may arise after you terminate your registration with the Services; and</li>
<li>disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the language agreed to above and as an alternative to arbitration, either you and/or the Company may bring an individual action against the other in small claims court. Additionally, you and/or the Company may bring any Claim against the other to the attention of a federal, state and/or local government entity, which may elect to seek relief against the Company on your behalf, and/or against you on the Company’s behalf.</p>

<p>You agree that you and the Company have voluntarily and intentionally waived any and all right to a trial by jury, and (except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement) any and all right to participate in a class action. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute provision. This Dispute provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>For you or the Company to initiate arbitration against the other party it must first send by certified mail to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice must identify and detail the nature of the party's Claim, the basis for that Claim, and the specific relief being sought for that Claim, including, without limitation, any Claim for injunctive relief. For the parties' convenience, a form for providing Notice is available at <a href="/disputeresolution_forms.html">http://www.hi5.com/disputeresolution_forms.html</a> to download and complete. A Notice being sent to the Company must be addressed to: Dispute Resolution Department, The Meet Group, Inc., Attention: General Counsel, 100 Union Square Drive, New Hope, PA 18938 (“Company Notice Address"). A Notice being sent to you shall be sent to the e-mail address associated with your Services account and to any other e-mail address provided in your registration (collectively, "Member Notice Address"). You may also opt to receive a copy of any Notice via mail by sending a written request to the Company Notice Address including your name, postal address, Member Notice Address and Services User ID number (UID).</p>

<p>After receipt of the Notice you and the Company must attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute set forth in the Notice. If you and the Company are not able to resolve the dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or the Company may initiate an arbitration proceeding against the other by downloading and completing the "American Arbitration Association ("AAA") Consumer-Related-Disputes Form-California (For Use Only In California)" demand for arbitration form available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased">Demand for Arbitration</a> ("Demand"), and sending a copy of the Demand to the AAA, together with a copy of the Terms of Service and a check or money order payable to the AAA in the amount of the appropriate filing fee, and sending a copy of the Demand to the other party. The copy of the Demand being sent to the AAA must be addressed as stated on the Demand. A copy of the Demand being sent to the Company must be addressed to the Company Notice Address. A copy of the Demand being sent to you shall be addressed to the Member Notice Address.</p>

<p>Please note AAA does not provide the Company customer support and is only able to provide information regarding initiating an arbitration proceeding against the Company. All concerns regarding your account should be addressed to the Company by submitting a <a href="/contact.html">Ticket</a>. The Company will try to resolve your concern, and in the case that you are not satisfied with the resolution you may choose to follow the process outlined on the <a href="/disputeresolution.html">Dispute Resolution Page</a>.</p>

<p>Information regarding the appropriate filing fee to send with the Demand to the AAA (including the possible waiver of all or part of that fee) is available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?doc=ADRSTAGE2021424&amp;_afrLoop=63188734472265&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D63188734472265%26doc%3DADRSTAGE2021424%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dz2k4h4cz8_254">AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> and <a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTAGE2026862">https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTAGE2026862</a>, or by calling AAA Customer Service at (800) 778-7879 or AAA Case Filing Services at (877) 495-4185. If you initiate an arbitration proceeding against the Company and are not able to pay all or part of the AAA filing fee (and do not receive a waiver of the unpayable amount), and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send a written request for payment of the unpayable amount to the Company at the Company Notice Address. The Company shall consider your request and will, in its own discretion, either (1) pay the unpayable amount to the AAA directly or (2) send notice to you of its denial of your request within 10 business days of the receipt thereof. Further, if you initiate an arbitration proceeding against the Company, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the Demand is $10,000 or less, then you may send proof of your payment of all or part of the AAA filing fee to the Company at the Company Notice Address, and the Company shall reimburse you for that actually paid amount.</p>

<p>The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA and shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures and the AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Agreement.

(Additional information about the arbitration process, presented in a simplified FAQ format, is available at <a href="/disputeresolution.html">http://www.hi5.com/disputeresolution.html</a>. The arbitrator selected to resolve the dispute between you and the Company shall bound by the terms of this Agreement. All arbitration hearings shall take place exclusively in San Francisco County, California. Except, however, that if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less you may choose whether the arbitration shall be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephone hearing, or by an in-person hearing, as established by the AAA Rules. If the total amount you are seeking is greater than $10,000 then your and the Company’s respective rights to an arbitration hearing shall be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which any award is based.</p>

<p>In addition to any reimbursement of AAA filing fees as detailed above, and so long as the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is $10,000 or less, the Company shall pay all other AAA administration fees and all arbitrator fees for the arbitration. Except, however, that if the arbitrator in such action finds that either the substance of your dispute against the Company or the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees in such action shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In said event, you hereby agree to reimburse the Company for all monies paid by the Company that are your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Additionally, if the total amount of the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is greater than $10,000 then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>

<p>You and the Company agree that unless and until the arbitrator determines the monetary and/or other relief, if any, to which you and/or the Company is entitled in connection with the dispute being arbitrated, neither you nor the Company shall disclose to the arbitrator the amount of any settlement offer(s) that you and/or the Company previously made to the other in connection with said dispute. In any individual arbitration between you and the Company, if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of the Company’s last written settlement offer to you then the Company shall:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay you the amount of the award or $2,500 (the "Member Incentive"), whichever is greater; and</li>
<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against the Company in the arbitration (collectively, the "Attorney Incentive").</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the Company did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said individual arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against the Company, you and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Member Incentive and the Attorney Incentive, respectively. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the individual arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or the Company made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said individual arbitration. The Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the individual arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses. If the Company prevails in an individual arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, the Company hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award.</p>

<p>The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief in your favor, but solely to the extent warranted by your individual Claim. You and the Company agree that, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may bring a Claim against the other solely in your or the Company’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, except as otherwise set forth herein, no arbitrator may consolidate more than one person's Claim and/or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If all or part of this specific paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall be deemed null and void.</p>

<p>AT ANY TIME AND IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION THE COMPANY MAY DIRECT THE AAA TO CONSOLIDATE ANY AND ALL PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION CLAIMS THAT (i) ARISE IN SUBSTANTIAL PART FROM THE SAME AND/OR RELATED TRANSACTIONS, EVENTS AND/OR OCCURRENCES, AND (ii) INVOLVE A COMMON QUESTION OF LAW AND/OR FACT WHICH, IF RESOLVED IN MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL AND NON-CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, MAY RESULT IN CONFLICTING AND/OR INCONSISTENT RESULTS. IN SAID EVENT, YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION, IN LIEU OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, OF ANY AND ALL CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST THE COMPANY AND THE AAA RULES SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL GOVERN ALL PARTIES. Additionally, in said event, if the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Company’s last written settlement offer to you then the Company shall:</p>

<ul>
<li>pay you the amount of the award or three times the amount of the Company’s last written settlement offer to you (the "Member Incentive"), whichever is greater; and</li>
<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of any fees, and reimburse said attorney any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that said attorney reasonably and actually accrues in investigating, preparing and pursuing your Claim against the Company in the arbitration (collectively, the "Attorney Incentive").</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the Company did not make any written settlement offer to you prior to the arbitrator in said consolidated arbitration issuing you an award, then so long as the arbitrator awards you any monetary relief on the merits of your Claim against the Company, then you shall be entitled to receive the award and/or $500, whichever is greater, and your attorney (if any) shall be entitled to receive the Attorney Incentive. As also noted above, the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of any fees and/or expenses, the Member Incentive and/or the Attorney Incentive at any time during the consolidated arbitration and/or upon request by you and/or the Company made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits of said arbitration. Similarly, the Attorney Incentive supplements and does not supersede any right you may have under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses in connection with the consolidated arbitration (including as may be awarded to you by the arbitrator), but in no event may you recover a duplicative award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses. If the Company prevails in a consolidated arbitration against you and is entitled under applicable law to receive attorneys' fees and/or expenses, the Company hereby agrees that it shall not seek and shall refuse to receive such an award. If all or part of this specific paragraph is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable after final appeal, then the entirety of this Dispute provision shall be deemed null and void.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if the Company changes this Disputes provision in the future (other than a change to the Company Notice Address and/or any Internet address, telephone number and/or document title set forth in this provision) you may reject that change by sending written notice within 30 days of the change to the Company at the Company Notice Address. By rejecting said change you reaffirm that you shall seek to resolve all disputes between you and the Company solely through arbitration in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

<p>If there is a dispute between participants on the Services, or any third party, the Company is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that Member has a dispute with one or more members, Member hereby releases the Company and its directors, officers, employees, agents, independent contractors, representatives, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns and licensees from all claims, actions, losses, liabilities, judgments, damages, costs and expenses of every kind or nature (regardless of whether actual or consequential, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed), arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or any the Services. If Member is a California resident, Member hereby waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which says "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
