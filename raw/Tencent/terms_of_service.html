            <p id="top"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
            <p>Welcome  to Tencent! </p>
            <p>We  offer a diverse range of services to our users. Your use of our products and  services (“<strong><em>services</em></strong><em>” </em>or “<strong><em>our  services</em></strong>”) is subject to these Terms of Service (these "<strong><em>Terms</em></strong>")  – so please read them carefully. </p>
            <p>Thank  you for reviewing these Terms – we hope you enjoy using our services.</p>
            <p class="italic">Compliance with these  Terms</p>
            <p><strong>These Terms apply to  you if you are a user of our services anywhere in the world, except if you  belong in any of the following categories: (i) a user of our services  (regardless of nationality) in the People’s Republic of China; (ii) a citizen  of the People’s Republic of China using our services anywhere in the world; or  (iii) a Chinese-incorporated company using our services anywhere in the world.  If you belong in any of those categories, you are subject instead to the <a href="http://www.qq.com/contract.shtml" target="_blank"><em>Terms of Service (PRC Users) </em></a>in your use  of our services. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Please review these  Terms and our policies and instructions to understand how you can and cannot  use our services. You must comply with  these Terms in your use of our services and only use our services as permitted  by applicable laws and regulations, wherever you may be when you use them. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>If you do not agree  to these Terms, you must not use our services. </strong></p>
            <p class="italic">Contracting Entity</p>
            <p>By  using our services, you agree to enter into these Terms with Tencent  International Service Pte. Ltd., a Singaporean company located at 10 Anson  Road, #21-07 International Plaza, Singapore 079903 (“<strong><em>we</em></strong>”, “<strong><em>our</em></strong>”  and “<strong><em>us</em></strong>”). </p>
            <p>We  may specify in certain of our service-specific terms that you are contracting  with one of our affiliate companies (instead of Tencent International Service  Pte. Ltd.) in relation to your use of the service (or services) to which the  relevant service-specific terms apply. Where this is the case, the relevant contracting  entity will be identified in the relevant service-specific terms, and these  Terms (including the relevant service-specific terms) will apply between you  and that identified contracting entity in relation to your use of the relevant  service (or services). </p>
            <p class="italic">Other terms in  relation to these Terms</p>
            <p>If  you are under the age of 13, you must not use our services. If you are between  the ages of 13 and 18 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction where you are  considered a minor), your parent or guardian must agree to these Terms (both  for themselves and on your behalf) before you can use our services. </p>
            <p>If  you are using our services on behalf of a company, partnership, association,  government or other organisation (your “<strong><em>Organisation</em></strong>”), you warrant that you  are authorised to do so and that you are authorised to bind your Organisation  to these Terms. In such circumstances “you” will include your Organisation. </p>
            <p>We  may translate these Terms into multiple languages. In the event there is any  difference between the English version and any other language version of these  Terms, the English version will apply (to the extent of the difference and to  the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations). </p>
            <p><strong>ADDITIONAL TERMS AND POLICIES</strong></p>
            <p>We  offer a diverse range of services, so there are certain additional terms and  policies that may be applicable to your use of all of our services or to  specific services, as set out in this section and as otherwise notified to you  from time to time. These additional terms of service and policies all form part  of and are incorporated into these Terms. </p>

            <p>We  may suspend or terminate your access to your account or any or all of our  services: (i) if we reasonably believe that you have breached these Terms; (ii)  if your use of our services creates risk for us or for other users of our  services, gives rise to a threat of potential third party claims against us or  is potentially damaging to our reputation; (iii) if you fail to use our  services for a prolonged period; or (iv) for any other reason.

            <p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>
            <p>These  Terms are the entire agreement between you and us in relation to our  services. You agree that you will have  no claim against us for any statement which is not explicitly set out in these  Terms. The invalidity of any provision  of these Terms (or parts of any provision) will not affect the validity or  enforceability of any other provision (or the remaining parts of that  provision). If a court holds that we cannot enforce any part of these Terms as  drafted, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent  enforceable under applicable laws and regulations, without changing the  remaining terms of these Terms. No delay  in enforcing any provision of these Terms will be construed to be a waiver of  any rights under that provision. Any  rights and obligations under these Terms which by their nature should survive,  including but not limited to any obligations in relation to the liability of,  or indemnities (if any) given by, the respective parties, will remain in effect  after termination or expiration of these Terms. </p>
            <p>No  person other than you and us will (subject to any applicable laws and  regulations) have any right to enforce  these Terms against any person, and you may not delegate, assign or transfer  these Terms or any rights or obligations under these Terms, without our prior  consent. We may freely assign, transfer or sub-contract these Terms or our  rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without your  prior consent or notice. You acknowledge and agree that in no event will our  partners or affiliate companies have any liability under these Terms. </p>
            <p><strong>GOVERNING LAW AND  DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>
            <p>Except  to the extent that: (i) any applicable additional terms incorporated into these  Terms provide differently, or (ii) the applicable laws and regulations of your  jurisdiction mandate otherwise (for instance, you may have statutory rights in  your jurisdiction in relation to bringing or defending claims in a local court  (including small claims court (or similar court)),  these Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these  Terms will be governed by the law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region. </p>
            <p>Any dispute, controversy or claim (whether in  contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, relating to, or in connection with  these Terms, including their existence, validity, interpretation, performance,  breach or termination, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration  administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre under the Hong  Kong International Arbitration Centre Administered Arbitration rules in force  when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted. The seat of the arbitration will  be Hong Kong. There will be one arbitrator only. The arbitration proceedings  will be conducted in English. </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>TERMS OF SERVICE (USA-SPECIFIC TERMS)</strong></p>
            <p><em>If you are a user of  our services in the United States of America, the below terms are incorporated  into these Terms, and override these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency.</em></p>
            <p>If you are a California resident, you agree to waive California Civil  Code Section 1542, and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction (if you  are a resident of such other jurisdiction), which states: "A general  release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect  to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by  him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”</p>
            <p>EACH  OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS  ACTION IN  ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.</p>

              <strong>TERMS OF SERVICE (AUSTRALIA-SPECIFIC TERMS)</strong></p>
            <p><em>If you are a user of  our services in Australia, the below terms are incorporated into these Terms,  and override these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency.</em></p>
            <p>All  express or implied guarantees, warranties, representations, or other terms and  conditions relating to these Terms or their subject matter, not contained in  these Terms, are excluded from these Terms to the maximum extent permitted by  applicable laws and regulations.</p>
            <p>Nothing  in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, warranty, term or  condition, right or remedy implied or imposed by any applicable laws and  regulations which cannot lawfully be excluded, restricted or modified. </p>
            <p>If  any guarantee, condition, warranty or term is implied or imposed by any  applicable laws and regulations and cannot be excluded (a <strong><em>“Non-Excludable Provision”</em></strong>),  and we are able to limit your remedy for a breach of the Non-Excludable  Provision, then our liability for breach of the Non-Excludable Provision is  limited to one or more of the following at our option:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>in the  case of goods, the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods,  the repair of the goods, the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of  acquiring equivalent goods, or the payment of the cost of having the goods  repaired; or</li>
              <li>in the  case of services, the supplying of the services again, or the payment of the  cost of having the services supplied again.</li>
